FuzzyArabicDict
===============

Django dictionary app that allows you to look up Arabic words in transliteration

This is basically Django glue to bring together work by others, particularly:
- [Yamli](http://yamli.com) Arabic transliteration 
- Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer [LDC2002L49](http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/catalogEntry.jsp?catalogId=LDC2002L49)
